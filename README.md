:zap: An experimental PureScript prelude.

I often have delusions of grandeur about creating my own programming language.
Realistically, I would never finish such a project. HasAnd my language would end
up being an ML a lot like Haskell and PureScript. So instead of creating my own
language, I decided to see how hard it would be to create my own core library
on top of an existing language.

This is just an experiment. Please don't take it seriously.
